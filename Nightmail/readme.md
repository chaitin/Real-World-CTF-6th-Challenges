About the challenge:

* Environment setup: You can use the software installation package provided in the attachment to build a local environment for test. You can follow the default steps during installation, except for the `Set up encryption` step, you should choose `Continue without encryption` option.

* Find the vulnerability: Try to find a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in eM Client installed in Windows, the vulnerability should be triggered when the victim clicks the malicious email sent by you.

* Capture the flag: After your exploit successfully works in your local environment, you can connect to `nc 47.89.252.163:1337` to apply for your team's independent vm environment and then try to obtain the flag.

About the vm:

* OS: Windows Server 2022 x64
* Software version: eM Client v9.2.2157
* Path to flag: `C:\\flag`
* After the vm starts, an automated script will simulate logging into eM Client with the victim email address. After waiting for 5 minutes, it will click on the most recent email in the inbox.
* The vm will be destroyed after 15 minutes.
* If you are sure that your exploit can work locally but keeps failing in the remote vm environment, please contact me (@voidfyoo) on discord channel.
